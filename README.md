- Function Definitions: Functions for calculating CAGR, ROI, Win/Loss Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and analyzing the financial statement are defined.
- Load and Prepare Data: The script prompts the user to input the name of the trade history file, loads the data using pandas, and performs sorting and data manipulation.
- Financial Statement Analysis: The data is analyzed using the defined functions, and the results are printed to the console.
- Plots: Various plots, including cumulative returns, daily returns, continuous returns, and ROI over time, are generated using matplotlib.



## 7. Dependencies
The Financial Analyzer code relies on the following dependencies:
(More exhaustive and complete list of requirements is mentioned in `requirements.txt`)
